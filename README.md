# Calculator
This was my first try creating a calculator.

It is quite a basic idea, a calculator created using HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript. Perhaps it is not perfect, but I am content with the results, and it was a great practice for JavaScript, which I believe is the most important part about it.

(I was never good at math, so making a calculator is a bit ironic for me.)
